# Flash Cards Application

This is a windows forms application that loads the alphabets of a language from a json file, and uses that data as flash cards. It is a basic Flash Card application for now, it doesn't maintain the scores, but while runing, it keeps track of score.

This is the main window, where you select the language. The languages are picked up from the json file under data folder.

This is the Flash Card view, where it either randomly shows flash cards and you have to guess the answers and enter them in the text box, or hit next, it will show the window below.

When you answer incorrectly, it shows the character and it's English Equivalent, so that you can learn and not make the same mistake :)

This is a draft application - Any questions, let me know!
